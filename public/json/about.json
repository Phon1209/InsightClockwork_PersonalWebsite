  "intro": "I am Patiphon Loetsuthakun, a Thai Olympiad scholar of the Royal Thai government, passionate about delivering engaging technology and computer science lessons to everyone.",
  "goal_transition": "...That is my long-term goal.",
  "goal": "My current short-term goal is to master website development and development operations on trending technologies such as Next.JS, docker, and Kubernetes, as well as look for new future-proof technology to learn.",
  "why": "In my high-school years at Suankularb Wittayalai school, I was fortunate enough to be part of the school's computer club. The activities we organized helped me realize that teaching people is an enjoyable task for me. It helps me empathize with the students I teach.   After the Olympiad scholarship was announced for those who participated in the Olympiad camp, I knew I had to get it for its two merits: study abroad in the US and guarantee a professor position at a Thai university.   Both are necessary steps to achieve my goal as I can learn more that is not available in Thailand.   Now what is left for me is getting as much knowledge as possible and make it touch students' enthusiasm.  ",
  "hobby": "Another thing I love to do while learning is to observe the professor and the reaction of students to analyze the efficacy of various teaching methods. Since my goal is to pass on the knowledge, I must consider how long the lifespan of these technologies is and how well they perform on the industrial scale. "
